# Passage41-50
## Passage 41 
[3s Version](): Wounds to the mane area are often difficult to observe serves as an obstacle to verify the prediction that --- males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently.

### Logic
1. 句1的铺垫作用，通常直接与句2前半段相关；但是句2前半段的行为/代名词 可能要去句2后半段找
> **Darker mane hairs are thicker than lighter hairs, so darker manes may provide better protection.** These ideas suggest that males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently and/or with less severity on the area covered by the mane, **but direct tests of this prediction are difficult.**   
> Highlighted 部分 提供了 “一个特定预测” 的证据。    
> 其中，“特定预测”是对句2前半段的总结，但是这个代名词，是直接从句2后半段得到的，不是自己想的。
