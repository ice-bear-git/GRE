# Passage41-50
## Passage 41 
[3s Version](): Wounds to the mane area are often difficult to observe serves as an obstacle to verify the prediction that --- males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently.

### Logic
1. 句1的铺垫作用，通常直接与句2前半段相关；但是句2前半段的行为/代名词 可能要去句2后半段找
> **Darker mane hairs are thicker than lighter hairs, so darker manes may provide better protection.** These ideas suggest that males with longer and darker manes will be wounded less frequently and/or with less severity on the area covered by the mane, **but direct tests of this prediction are difficult.**   
> Highlighted 部分 提供了 “一个特定预测” 的证据。    
> 其中，“特定预测”是对句2前半段的总结，但是这个代名词，是直接从句2后半段得到的，不是自己想的。


### Knowledge

> The male lion's mane ....; 雄狮的鬓毛  
> males ... 后续句子中的males可以直接指代为“雄狮”

## Passage 42
[3s Version](): Helen Levitt's technique is objective, while her content is subjective
### Logic
1. seems后面，被动语态也会省略"be"
> Levitt's subjects **seems caught unawares**. Levitt的对象 该上去是无意识得被抓拍的。

2. To/Of
> There is a paradox to her technique. 她的技术中有一个矛盾 -- 比如标榜自己随机抓拍，但是会自己斟酌选景 -- 目的与表达方式的不对应   
> There is a paradox of her technique. 她有一个关于技术的矛盾 -- 比如用广角拍深景深 -- 技术不专业

### Knowledge
1. off-the-cut aesthetic
> off-the-cut: 没有被切过的. --- 真实客观的 审美 ---- 客观性的审美

2. 表述艺术家自己的观点/看法时
> His **own distinctive preoccupations** and **ways of seeing**

3. 就算是声称“客观抓拍”的艺术，也会因为主观上对取景的选择，而让技术上的客观变得不纯粹。艺术领域，几乎没有办法做到绝对客观。
> 技术上的主观可以是： arrange the scenes or pose the subjects she photographed.    
> 技术上的客观是：off-the-cut aesthetic (未过度处理的审美); **candid** and **spontaneous** (**抓拍的&即兴的**)； 

4. Appear To --- 作用题的常见phrase --- 重点在appear to紧接着的[n.]描述
> Which of the following **appears to** *ensure the objectivity* of Levitt's photographs?  
> 下列哪一个选项，**可能会** 确保Levitt照片的客观性？

5. 主观性
> Photographer and suject **conspire** in the making of a portrait. 摄影师和拍摄对象，会合作创作，一幅人像摄影.   
> ~=: subjects in an Evans' photograph become **collaborator in** the portrait's **creation**. Evans照片中的拍摄对象成了人像创作的合作者。
> 

6. 有一些主义的命名，都是远远落后于画作刚出现的时候/年代。
> As a "street" photographer, before the term's invention, Levitt has claimed to have attempted to capture life as she found it.   
> ~=: It had not been named as such when Levitt began practicing this kind of photography.
> 
> 同时，**不要 直译 一切有“引号”的短语！！！！** 这首先不是重点，其次可能不是正确的(由于过于绝对)   
> "street photographer" != She took photographs in public places rather than in a studio
