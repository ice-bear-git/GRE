# Passage31-40
## Passage 31 
[3s Version](): The relevance of the literary personality--xxx--to the analysis of a literaray work is being scrutinzed by various schools of contemporary criticism.

### Logic
1. 如果一个句子有两个破折号，可以先跳过中间的解释部分，理解主句的含义--思路主旨题。双破折号中间的部分--细节题。
>However, to readers interested in literary detective work **-- say scholars of classical (Greek and Roman) literature who wish to reconstruct damaged texts or deduce a work's authorship --** the literary personality sometimes provide vital clues.

Reduce to:

>However, to readers interested in literary detective work, the literary personality sometimes provide vital clues.

2. A would most likely agree with the B that...
>必须是B拥有的点，才能被A认同或否定 -- 即答案必须为AB共同拥有的！

### Knowledge
Some schools of contemporary criticism (多个当代评论界学派):
* Deconstructionists (解构主义)
* New historicists (新历史主义)
* scholars of classical literature (复古派学者)


### Verbal
* [scrutinize](): examine or inspect closely and thoroughly.
* [intertextuality](): interrelationship with other texts. -- 互文性

## Passage 32
[3s Version](): 人类文化学应该是主观的，而非实证的。   
从前的学者，就算标榜自己是实证的，其实也没有认清自己理论中暗藏的biases。（相当于过去的理论又当又立，本身是主观的，却标榜自己是客观的，然后用认为是客观--但其实不准确的--数据库）


### Logic
1. 开头的代词，多指代前一句的主语。尤其注意中间有无人物关系的变化。
>**Many culturla anthropologists** .... **They** argue that ....
2. 有The的名词指代，说明前一句已经出现过其本体。
>Anthropology should stop striving to build a better database about cultural behavior and should turn to developing **a more humanistics interpretation of cultures**. **The new framework** holds that it may be more enlightening to investigate the biases of earlier texts than to cuntinue with empirical methodolies.  

**The new framework = a more humanistics interpretation.**

3. 题目中，确定人物/人群下，前后的时间差异是极为关键的！尤其是文章中在讲今昔对比时。
因此，**现在“不认可的”**，可能是，**过去“相信的”**。
>Text:  
>Many cultural anthropologist have come to reject the scientific framework of empiricism that dominated the field until the 1970s and now regard all scientific knowledge as socially constructed.  
>Choice:
>Q: about most cultural anthropologists working prior to the 1970s
>A: They regarded scientific knowledge as consisting of empirical truths.

4. 在定词处，用“or/and”的正反双向描述时：它的**重点在名词**，而不是修饰。
> ... came from anthropologists who brought with them **a prepackaged set of** conscious and unconscious **biases**

### Knowledge
1. 关于文化人类学的观点
Cultural anthropology, according to the post-1970s critique, is unavoidably subjective, and the anthropologist should be explicit in acknowledging that fact.
**现代人类学家，基于1970s后的评论，本身不可避免得就是“主观的”，人类学家应该明确地承认这一事实。**

2. 文章的理性历史梳理
cultural anthropologists的信仰/根基经历了变化。  
1970前，they regard scientific knowledge as consisting of empricial truths;  
现在，他们意识到早期文本蕴含的biases, regard that scientific knowledge is also consturcted by society.   
The new framework holds that **it may be more enlightening to investigate the biases of earlier texts than to continue with empirical methodologies**：  



### Verbal
* [Anthripologists](): 
* [empiricism](): he belief that people should rely on practical experience and experiments, rather than on theories as, a basis for knowledge. (经验主义;实证主义)
* [scientific framework of empiricism](): 实证主义科学框架 
* [bring/brought with ...](): 拿来/取得...
* [prepackaged](): ~preprocessed/pre-filtered.
* [critique](): a written examination and judgment of a situation or of a person's work or ideas. 批评/评论

## Passage 33
[3s Version](): Distinguish seasonal ice from perennial ice.

### Logic
1. 文章越短，每一句话越要被看到/看懂。否则会缺失关键信息。
> Arctic see ice **comes in two varieties**.  
> **Seasonal ice** forms in winter and then melts in summer, while **perennial ice** persists year-round. 

2. 从句的标志词"which", 也可以用来做“解释”的标志词
> When ice begins to form in seawater, it forces out salt, **which** has no place in the crystal structure.  
> which指代的是salt; 实际上形成了因果关系


### Knowledge
1. 海冰的两种形态 肉眼很难分辨(seasonal ice is similar in appearance to perennial ice)，但是味道上可以分辨。
>To the untrained eye, all see ice looks similar, but by licking it, one can estimate how long a particular piece has been floating round.

2. 当溶液浓度够高时，不能够再次冻结
> As the ice gets thicker, the rejected salt collects in tiny pockets of brine too highly concentrated to freeze.


### Verbal
* [brine](): brine is salty water, especially salty water that is used for preserving food.
* [too concentrated to freeze](): 浓度太高以至于不能冻结
* [veinlike](): the thin tubes in your body through which your blood flows towards your heart. 静脉

## Passage 34
[3s Version](): suffragists' parade

### Logic
1. 关键的形容词包含了转折的意味：transgression
> a conscious transgression of the rules of social order.

如果错过了该形容词，还可以从细节（后续对应处的动词）描述发现情绪导向:
> .... transgression of rules of social order: ... **challenged** traditional notions of ....  
> 由此看出，前面为：“违反/违背”社会秩序； transgression ～= challeng 取反

### Knowledge
1. Party of Policy:
> suffragist---主张女性参政者主义;  
> 
> Antisuffragists;  
> Proponents of the "rule of social order" --- believed that it was undeminine for women to march in suffrage parades.

2. Functionality of Parades:
Recognize the parade's **rhetorical force as a vehicle for social change**;  

> Not only as apublic expression of suffragist solidarity, but also a conscious transgression of the rulse of social order: women's very presence in the streets challenged traditional notions of femininity and restriction on women's conduct. 

**drawbacks/"double-edged sowrd":**

> the women's efforts (parade) proclaim their solidarity left them open to patronizing commentary from press and public and to organized opposition from antisuffragists.
