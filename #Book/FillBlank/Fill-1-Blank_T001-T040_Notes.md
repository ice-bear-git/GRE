### Logic

* **Rather只有在“rather than”时，反义重复！**
	- rather than != rather： “而不是”
* **其余的rather = “似乎”**
	- [which **rather** seems to]() = 这**似乎**更像是
	- 更多的时候是：“似乎”，没有否定的意思。在翻译的时候可以省略

* 思路1:
	- 不把rather解读为否定之后，整句话只有Though与seldom形成反转。
	- frequent features ... VS seldom galvanize the public. 新闻经常报道，但是很难刺激到人们来采取行动。
* 思路2:
	- 只关注which这个解释性从句，取同:  
	such exposure seldom `___` the **public**, **which** rather seems to resign to a sense of impotency.
	- 群众是屈服于“无力感”的！resign to a sense of impotency
	- 由于，解释性取同，seldom `___` = 屈服于无力感
	- `___` 与 无力感 「反义」———— galvanize 刺激某人做某事
