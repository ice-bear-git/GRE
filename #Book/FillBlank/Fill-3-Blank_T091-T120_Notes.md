### Logic
### Text

For almost two centuries, the German island of Sylt has offered various therapies for every conceivable `malady` from broken bones to liver complaints. The local mud, saltwater, thermal pools, and spas have been deemed `healthful` by the German medical system, which `funds` some of these treatments. Consequently, the treatments are widely used.

### Verbal

	- [dispute](): vt. 辩论；阻止；抗拒；怀疑
	
### Text

Within the culture as a whole, the natural sciences have been so successful taht the word "scientific" is often used in `an honorific` manner: it is often assumed that to call something "scientific" is to imply that its reliability has been `maligned` by methods whose results cannot reasonably be `disputed`.


### Verbal

* [malign](): vt. 诽谤，中伤
* [cannot reasonably be disputed](): 不能被合理地反驳 --- 只能被接受是对的

	- 听话的 vs. 棘手的/难驾驭的
* `detestation` --> `sabotaging`
	- 厌恶/痛恨 --> 妨害；对…采取破坏行动

* `old-mannered compliance` --> `obsequious`
	- 举止温和(符合老规矩的)的 顺从 --> 奉承拍马的,卑躬屈膝的

### Text

Those who took Clark's old-mannered compliance for obsequiousness `condemned` him: his apparent `intractability` veiled a fervent `veneration` of the authority that others exercised over him, one that he occasionally expressed by discreetly sabotaging their most important projects.

## T 094
### Logic
* `augment` vs. `argument`


### Text

One sometimes hears that Marco Polo introduced pasta to the Western world, having encountered it in China. This durable **myth**, which `requires` that nothing should have been known of pasta in Italy until 1295, when Marco Polo returned from the FarEast, can easily be `debunked` by pointing out that there are Italian references to pasta that `predate that event`.

### Verbal

* [myth](): 虚构的人，虚构的事//神话//**谬误**
* [prasie its virtues](): 赞美它的优点

### Text

China's rapidly growing population is the main threat facing large **carnivores** in the People's Republic. Increasing policies aimed at limiting population growth have been `implemented`, nevertheless, the country's vast size and the isolation of many of its regions mean that human populations in areas where large carnivores still occur `can grow unchecked`. This human pressure has `doomed` the south China tiger.

### Verbal
* [doom](): 使倒霉
* [south China tiger](): 华南虎 

--------------------------


## T 096
### Logic

* [increasingly strained emulation](): 日益紧张的竞争 --- 竞相模仿

		+ `If you emulate something or someone, you imitate them because you admire them a great deal.` （因为钦慕而）仿效，模仿

### Text

A certain amount of theoretical **frenzy** about comics today is `understandable`. After all, similar frenzies have been in other art forms in periods of their rapid development, for instance, the debates about painting that roiled Renaissance Italy. But such intellectual `arousal` rarely precedes creative glory. On the contrary, it commonly indicates that an artistic `breakthrough`, having been made and recognized, is over, and that a process of increasingly strained emulation and diminishing returns has set in.

### Verbal
* [perplexing](): adj. 使人困惑的;令人费解的
* [understandable](): 可以理解的

* [frenzy about comics](): 关于漫画的狂热

## T 097
### Logic
* `profitmonger` Vs. `visionary` Vs. `innocent`
	- `唯利是图的人` Vs. `有远见的人` Vs. `无辜的人`
* 在电影行业中，详细区分两类人
	- producer 制片人
	- director 导演
	- 有人觉得，producer其实比director更重要

* Attacking what he calls ....
	- 攻击他所说的... ---> 代表，本文观点与他指代之人的看法相反 -- 取反


### Text

The notion of film producers as the **ogres** of the movie business has proved an `enduring` one, but according to *The Producers* by Tim Adler, it is not always grounded in reality. Attacking what he calls the "auteur myth"--the idea of the director as the single purveyor of art in an industry otherwise peopled with `profitmongers` -- he places at the heart of his book an image of the producer, not the director, as the primary `creative` force in the development and production of a movie.


### Verbal

* [ogre](): n. 食人魔鬼，怪物（童话等中的）；令人害怕的人
* [the ogres of the movie](): 电影产业的怪物

* [**profitmonger**](): 暴利者 profit-monger

* [**visionary**](): adj. 有眼光的，有远见的
--------------------------


## T 098
### Logic

### Text

The slow pace of job creation was without *precedent for* the period of recovery from a recession, but the conditions that **conspired to** cause the recession were also `atypical`. The stock market declined sharply, and rampant business investment slumped. Then an ensuing spate of scandals `weaken` public trust in the way companies were run. And yet, despite these powerful `counterforces` to growth, the recession proved surprisingly mild.

### Verbal
* [atypical](): adj. 非典型的
* [conspired to (cause)](): 合起来（**造成**）

## T 099
### Logic
### Text

In a view of 17 studies from 2008, Trudeau and Shephard concluded that reserving up to an hour a day for `physical activity` in school curricula does not `detract from` academic achievement. In fact, they noted that more exercise often `augmented` school performance, despite the time it took away from reading, writing, and arithmetic.

### Verbal
* [](): 
* [detract (from)](): vt. 转移，使分心//vi. 贬低；减去
* [augment school performance]

--------------------------


## T 100
### Logic
### Text

Despite the occasional `opulence` of their venues, the culture of corporate conferences is a deeply `ascetic` conference, each day consisted of nearly nine hours of continuous lectures and panels enlivened by pleasantries or anything that could be construed as a joke. The only `respite from` sensory deprivation of the sessions came from the handsome color sides favored by the corporate presenters.

### Verbal
* [Despite the occasional opulence of their venues](): 尽管他们开会的场地偶尔奢华
	- [**opulence**](): n. 富裕,富饶

--------------------------


## T 101
### Logic

* This seems an obvious conclusion in hindsight, but its implication --- `that geological processes in the distant past must have followed these very same laws` --- was revolutionary for geologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
	- 要理解整句话的含义，先把破折号中间的部分省略掉
		+ 从后世的角度，这是一个十分明显的结论；但是对于18-19世纪的地理学家，这份暗示是革命性的

### Text

A *transformative* scientific idea that emerged in the eighteenth century was the realization that slow, inexorable geological processes follow the basic laws of physics and chemistry. This seems `an obvious` conclusion in hindsight, but its implication --- that geological processes in the distant past must have `followed` these very same laws --- was `revolutionary for` geologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

### Verbal

* [A *transformative* scientific idea](): 具有颠覆性的科学理论
	- [transformative](): adj. 有改革能力的,变化的,变形的
* [the realization that slow, inexorable geological process follow ....](): 意识到了(缓慢的，不可阻挡)的地势变化, 伴随着...

## T 102
### Logic

* 阅读一定要看全， 比如最后一句中逗号后的`, but ...`
* Carving materials such as stone, bone, antler, wood, and ivory were `available locally`, but paper and drawing tools were unknown until introduced by early explorers and **missionaries**.
	- Carving的原材料很容易在本地获得，但是printing印刷需要的物件很难得到

### Text

Inuit print making is less `traditional` than carving in that it does not have substantial historical precedents, although there are `affinities with` incised carvings on bone or antler, facial tattoo marks, or inlay skin work on clothing, mitts and footwear. Carving materials such as stone, bone, antler, wood, and ivory were `available locally`, but paper and drawing tools were unknown until introduced by early explorers and **missionaries**.

### Verbal
* [does not have substantial historical precedents](): 不曾拥有很多历史先例
* [prestigious](): `A prestigious institution, job, or activity is respected and admired by people.` 有威望的；有声望的；有威信的；受尊敬的

## T 103
### Logic
* `inert`(无生气的;呆滞的) ~= `static and lifeless`
* `circumvent` the difficulties ~= tracing **tool**
	- 用工具，来绕过...的困难


### Text

The `inert` quality of much contemporary drawing may be attributable to the use of photography as a drawing shortcut. Photography `wonderfully enriched` modern arts, but when it is used as a tracing tool in order to `circumvent` the difficulties of achieving correct proportion, the resulting art often feels **static and lifeless**.

### Verbal
* [be attributable to ...](): 可以被归结于...
* [wonderfully enriched](): 完美充实
	- [enrich](): vt. 使肥沃；使富足；使充实


* [enervate](): vt. 使衰弱；使失去活力

--------------------------

## T 104
### Logic
### Text

For Plato the art of music was so `firmly anchored in` *moral and political reality* that any alteration of music system would necessarily require a corresponding political shift. But two and a hal millennia later, when classical music is generally seen merely as a lifestyle accessory, Plato's conception seems `absurd`. To be sure, there are still people who consider classical music to be of `profound` cultural importance, but few of them are able to articulate this convincingly.

### Verbal


* [rarely identified with](): 几乎不一致 
* [tenuously connected to](): 联系很微弱

	- [articulate](): 清楚地表达

--------------------------

## T 105
### Logic

* 科学报告(scientific paper/account) 有可能会 歪曲 研究过程

### Text

Scientific papers often `misrepresent` what actually happened in the course of the investigations they describe. Misunderstandings, blind alleys, and mistakes of various sorts will fail to appear in the final written accounts because `efficiency` is a desirable attribute when transmitting results in a scientific report and would be poorly served by `a comprehensive historical account`.

### Verbal
* [misrepresent](): 歪曲呈现
* [particularize](): 列举, 逐一叙述
* [investigation](): 调查，侦查

* [blind alley](): 死胡同
	- [alley](): n. 小径；小巷；小路


* [account](): 账户//记述，描述，**报道**

--------------------------


## T 106
### Logic

* [A so vividly conveyed in B](): 在B中，如此生动传达出来的A 

* Not only was `his personal correspondence intercepted` and `his movements monitored`.
	- 个人信件被拦截 & 个人行动被监视


### Text

Even the reader acquainted with the outlines of Pushkin's biography will be `confused by` the `concern for contemporary society` so vividly conveyed in Binyon's biography. Not only was Pushkin's personal correspondence intercepted and his movements `monitored`, but Tsar Nicholas I's decision to oversee Pushkin's career obliged Pushkin to submit all his manuscripts for inspection.

### Verbal
* [acquaint with](): 熟悉...
	- [acquaint](): vt. 使熟悉, 使了解 (know it/learn about it)

* [suffocating lack of creative freedom](): 创造性的自由 窒息般地 缺乏 -- 极度缺乏自由 --- 自由收到了限制

--------------------------


## T 107
### Logic

* 合作(corporation) 应该是属于 社会性(sociability)

* `..., or, to put it more sharply, ...` == 或者换个更犀利的说法

* 使个人从自身利益服从于群体的需要， (这个属性)**构成了人类成就的基础**.
	- make individuals subordinate their self-interest to the needs of the group, **lies at the root of human achievement**.

### Text

Biologists have little `compunction about` drawing the link between the success of humanity and human `sociability`. Indeed, many biologists claim that this attribute, the ability to `cooperate` , or, to put it more sharply, to make individuals subordinate their self-interest to the needs of the group, lies at the root of human achievement.


### Verbal
* [compunction (about)](): n. 内疚, 后悔, 懊悔
* [consensus (regarding)](): (关于...的) 一致意见
* [justification (for)](): (对于...的) 合理解释 

* [resilience](): 恢复力；适应力
--------------------------


## T 108
### Logic

* Photographer只是负责记录(document)，不管美丑(regargless of aesthetics)

### Text

Just because, as a photographer, Friedlander `is interested in` places that most people consider ugly does not mean that he is out to prove they are beautiful. Instead, his work suggests that the photographer simply cannot ignore so much of the built American landscape but is obligated to `document` what we pass through day in and day out, regardless of `aesthetics`.

### Verbal
* [tends to avoid](): 倾向于避免

* [is harshly critical of](): 严厉批评
* [is interested in](): 对..感兴趣

* [document](): 记录 
* [emulate]():

* [discredit](): 怀疑

* [authenticity](): 真实性

--------------------------


## T 109
### Logic

* [Founding myths](): 建国以来的传说
	- 在逻辑严密的GRE中，myth不论是谣言还是传说，都为反转关系埋下了伏笔

### Text

Traditional Vietnamese culture has long promoted the idea of gender equality. **Founding myths** `obscure` the equal division of labor in child care for mothers and fathers. As is often the case, however, theoretical commitments are `inspired by` actual processes. In reality, gender-based `parity` persists.

### Verbal
* [Vietnamese](): 越南的
* [promote](): **促进；推动；增进** // 筹划，发起，创立

* [obscure](): 使模糊
* [celebrate](): 赞美 
* [countermand](): 撤销命令 counter--mand

## T 110
### Logic

* `has pervaded its pages for a long time`: 已经在它的页面上流传了很长时间

* `erudite(博学的；有学问的)` && `authoritative(权威的)` ~~ `staleness(陈腐)`
	- 博学权威的代价 往往是 “陈腐”


### Text

Unlike most other serious journals, which drain money from their owners, the *Review* has long been `lucrative`. But the formula is not without its imperfections, which have grown more pronounced in recent years. The publication has always been **erudite** and `authoritative` but not always lively and readable. `A staleness`, accompanied by a certain aversion to risk taking, has pervaded its pages for a long time.

### Verbal

* [lucrative](): adj. 获利多的, 赚钱的
* [unesteemed](): 不受尊重
	- [esteemed](): 受尊重的

* [imperfection](): n. 不完美；缺点；瑕疵

* [animated](): 活泼的 
* [trendy](): 时髦的

* [**pervade**](): If something pervades a place or thing, it is a noticeable feature throughout it. 贯穿；弥漫；渗透
* []():

### Logic

* `a discernment about contemporary architecture` && `equal astuteness about contemporary art`
	- **`discernment` && `astuteness`**
	- (洞察力)敏锐，精明  && 机敏,精明

### Text

The new art museum's `outstanding` building augurs well for the ambitious institution because it speaks of `an intoxication by` contemporary architecture on the part of the board of directors that may `conceal` equal astuteness about contemporary art.


### Verbal

* [nondescript](): adj. 无明显特征的,**难以归类的**,难以形容的
* [a discernment about](): 对于...的洞察
	- [**discernment**](): n. <褒>识别能力；洞察力；敏锐，精明

--------------------------



## T 112
### Logic

### Text

Behavioral economists have come to believe that a **`surfeit`** of choices can be paralyzing as Schwartz pointed out in the recent book *The Paradox of Choice*. Studies of retirement plans show that the more investment choices a plan offers, the less likely people are to participate in it. It may follow, then that a lack of flexibility in certain plans may actually be a `virtue`. People reasonably `forgo` some advantages in exchange for peace of mind.

### Verbal
* [**surfeit**](): n. 过量,过度(尤指饮食) // vi. 由于过量而厌腻
* [**paralyze**](): vt. 使麻痹；使瘫痪

* [virtue](): n. 美德, 德行 // 优点, 长处
* [**conundrum**](): n. 谜,猜不透的难题,难答的问题

* `stimuate` Vs. `languish`
	- 刺激/促进 Vs. 变得(越来越)**衰弱**

### Text

Laws protecting intellectual property are intended to stimulate creativity, yet some forms of creative work have never enjoyed legal protection --- a situation that ought to be of great interest. 
If we see certain forms of creative endeavor `proliferating` as a result of uncontrolled copying, we might decide to `jettison` intellectual property law. Conversely, if unprotected creative work `declines in originality` in the absence of legal rules against copying, we would do well to know how such flourishing is sustained.

Now that photographic prints have become a popular field for collecting, auctions are becoming more `competitive`. It is not just th entry of new collectors into the field that is causing this intensification. Established collectors' interests are also becoming more `antiquarian`. Those who once concentrated on the work of either the nineteenth-century pioneers or the twentieth-century modernists are now keen to have `legitimate` collections.

The skin of the poison dart frog contains deadly poisons called batrachotoxins. But the `effect` of the toxins has remained an enigma, as the frog does not `suffer form` them. Now an analysis suggests that the melyrid beetle is the source. Collected beetle specimens all contained batrachotixins, suggesting that these beetles are `poisoned` by the frogs.

There are two opposing theories about mountain formation and climate over the past 40 million years: either the surge of mountain building `caused` the global cooling, or vice versa. The first of these two theories asserts that widespread mountain building cooled the earth as result of `complexity of` mountains and climate. For example, mountain glaciers tend to be `self-perpetuating`: once established, they increase the reflectivity of the surface, thus lowering temperatures and allowing more ice to form.

Galaxy Zoo set a standard for citizen-scientist participation project. Zealous volunteers `astonished` the project's organizers by classifying an entire catalog of galaxies years ahead of shcedule. `Embarrased` by the `stoicism` of the volunteers, the Galaxy Zoo team was inspired to pursue lines of reasearch they had never even imagined.

While some commentators suggest that abstraction and complexity in scientific reasearch are signs that a given direction is misguided, Lisa Randall, a professor of physics at Harvard, counters that these qualities instead reflect the success of human ingenuity in `creating` the increasingly `pragmatic` challenges that nature presents. They can, however, make it more `unproductive` to communicate scientific developments, even to colleague.

Gravitational waves --- ripples in the geometry of space-time --- are analogous to electromagnetic waves. The challenge in trying to observe these waves directly is that they are extremely weak. To make waves large enough to be `detectable`, the most `obvious` events in the universe are required: supernova explosions, the formation of black holes, or the collision of stars. Even so, the effects are `minscule`. The geometry changes so little that a distance of several kilometers changes by less than the diameter of a proton.

For many years, Americans have had a love affair with ferryboats. Ferries are said to relieve our frayed nerves after we've stewed in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and conventional wisdom also says ferries `provocative` congestion and air pollution by getting us out of out cars. Unfortunately, this romantic but `misguided` notion recently has `captivated` several West Coast mayors, who have in consequence eagerly pursued the implementation of ferry service in their cities.
