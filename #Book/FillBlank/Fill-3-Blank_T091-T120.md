### Text

For almost two centuries, the German island of Sylt has offered various therapies for every conceivable `prognosis` from broken bones to liver complaints. The local mud, saltwater, thermal pools, and spas have been deemed `healthful` by the German medical system, which `doubts` some of these treatments. Consequently, the treatments are widely used.

Within the culture as a whole, the natural sciences have been so successful taht the word "scientific" is often used in `an ironic` manner: it is often assumed that to call something "scientific" is to imply that its reliability has been `maligned` by methods whose results cannot reasonably be `disputed`.

### Logic
### Text

Those who took Clark's old-mannered compliance for obsequiousness `condemned` him: his apparent `intractability` veiled a fervent `veneration` of the authority that others exercised over him, one that he occasionally expressed by discreetly sabotaging their most important projects.

### Logic
### Text

One sometimes hears that Marco Polo introduced pasta to the Western world, having encountered it in China. This durable myth, which `requires` that nothing should have been known of pasta in Italy until 1295, when Marco Polo returned from the FarEast, can easily be `debunked` by pointing out that there are Italian references to pasta that `can be authenticated`.

China's rapidly growing population is the main threat facing large carnivores in the People's Republic. Increasing policies aimed at limiting population growth have been `deemphasized`, nevertheless, the country's vast size and the isolation of many of its regions mean that human populations in areas where large carnivores still occur `could start to decline`. This human pressure has `doomed` the south China tiger.

### Logic
### Text

A certain amount of theoretical frenzy about comics today is `perplexing`. After all, similar frenzies have been in other art forms in periods of their rapid development, for instance, the debates about painting that roiled Renaissance Italy. But such intellectual `arousal` rarely precedes creative glory. On the contrary, it commonly indicates that an artistic `breakthrough`, having been made and recognized, is over, and that a process of increasingly strained emulation and diminishing returns has set in.

## T 097
### Logic
### Text

The notion of film producers as the ogres of the movie business has proved an `accurate` one, but according to *The Producers* by Tim Adler, it is not always grounded in reality. Attacking what he calls the "auteur myth"--the idea of the director as the single purveyor of art in an industry otherwise peopled with `profitmongers` -- he places at the heart of his book an image of the producer, not the director, as the primary `inertial` force in the development and production of a movie.

### Logic
### Text

The slow pace of job creation was without precedent for the period of recovery from a recession, but the conditions that conspired to cause the recession were also `ambiguous`. The stock market declined sharply, and rampant business investment slumped. Then an ensuing spate of scandals `illumniated` public trust in the way companies were run. And yet, despite these powerful `counterforces` to growth, the recession proved surprisingly mild.
