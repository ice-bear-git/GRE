* 低浓度的药可能导致生物致死率更高

### Text

In *aquatic* environments, the herbicide atrazine is more likely to `kill` developing amphibians when it is highly diluted than when it is much more concentrated, a new study suggests. Although counterintuitive, the finding is `consistent with` some past research on atrazine and studies show that other hormonally active compounds are most damaging at trace concentrations.

Proponents of international regulation of environmental issues have always struggled against scientific uncertainty and economic hostility.

Theirony of digital networking is that it can produce more `provincialism` than did the geographical confinement it supposedly transcended.
